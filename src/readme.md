# Argent Sea
The principal goal is of the Argent Sea framework is to optimize 
data access performance, while minimizing the overhead of custom coding.

The framework combines:
* The convenience to the programmer of an ORM tool
* The performance of direct ADO.NET calls to stored procedures
* The scalability of application data sharding

Currently, the Argent Sea framework supports both 
*[Microsoft Sql Server](https://github.com/argentsea/sql)* 
and *[PostgreSql](https://github.com/argentsea/pg)* data platforms. 
This project contains the shared code used by both the ArgentSea.Sql 
project and the ArgentSea.Pg project.
